# FiThesis

This is a fork of LaTeX style used for theses at [Masaryk University](http://www.muni.cz) (Brno, Czech Republic).

## Installation

Please follow instructions mentioned on sites about former versions of this style (see below).

## Warning

PDF version of faculty logo seems to be quirky. On output of some printers (including those in thesis-printing companies) it appeares distorted and unreadable. Better [make your own version](http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/fi-logo/) and first try to print it before you rely on my version (trust me, having such issue while trying to print your thesis on last minute is not a lovely experience). Pull requests trying to fix this problem are very welcome.
